"""Portable LoRA weight transfer: stage the adapter, then tell engines to load it.

Miles has two transports that declare ``supports_lora``: ``broadcast`` (an NCCL
collective spanning trainer ranks and engines) and ``cuda_ipc`` (same host only).
Both are bound to one vendor, and cuda_ipc to one host, so neither can carry an
adapter from a trainer on NVIDIA GPUs to engines on AMD GPUs -- NCCL and RCCL do
not interoperate. The transports that DO work across hosts, ``p2p`` and
``disk-delta``, both ``assert lora_rank <= 0``.

``load_lora_adapter_from_tensors`` looks like the portable escape hatch but is
not: SGLang's ``MultiprocessingSerializer`` emits a fixed-size shared-memory
handle rather than bytes (a 64 B tensor serialises to 464 chars, a 2 MB tensor to
472), so the data never travels. It also has no caller in the repo.

What is portable is a file plus a path-based load, which the engine already
exposes: ``POST /load_lora_adapter {"lora_name", "lora_path", "pinned"}``.

So rank 0 gathers the adapter, writes safetensors to --update-weight-disk-dir,
and POSTs the path. As with disk-delta, that directory is expected to be visible
to the engines; --custom-update-weight-post-write-path covers the case where it
is not. Nothing but HTTP and a filesystem crosses
the boundary, so the trainer and the engines need not share a vendor, an
interconnect, or a host. Only sane for LoRA: a full-weight sync this way would
move the whole model every step.

``use_weight_update_session = False`` because this protocol owns registration and
reload itself; it does not need the session frame's pause/resume around a
collective that is not happening.
